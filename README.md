# rubixcube
This is a virtual Rubix Cube that solves itself OR allows patterns to be entered 
from a real cube, and then it solves that AND provides turn by turn instructions 
allowing a user to solve a real rubix cube.

This was created in HTML, CSS, and JavaScrip/jQuery.

I was able to create this when I had only a beginners understanding of HTML, CSS 
and JavaAcript. If you look at the code you may notice there is a ton of refactoring 
that can be done. That's OK, it works (mostly), and I am damn proud of it.
One of these days I'm going to clean it up, but for now here you go.
